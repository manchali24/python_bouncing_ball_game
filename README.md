# python_bouncing_ball_game

DESCRIPTION:

The physics of bouncing ball concerns the physical behaviour of bouncing balls, particularly the motion before, during, and after impact against the surface of another body. We are using python GUI to design this game. 

The graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of user interface that allows user to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, instead of text-based user-interface typed command labels or text-navigation.

Add these packages:

1. from tkinter import *
2. import time
