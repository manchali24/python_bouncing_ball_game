# python_bouncing_ball_game

DESCRIPTION:

The physics of bouncing ball concerns the physical behaviour of bouncing balls, particularly the motion before, during, and after impact against the surface of another body. We are using python GUI to design this game. 

The graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of user interface that allows user to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, instead of text-based user-interface typed command labels or text-navigation.

Add these packages:

1. from tkinter import *
2. import time

You must install Python 3.5 or above. I have used Python 3.7

You can use any software to run this project like Pycharm, IDLE, etc.

Analysis:

After when you run this project, you will see output in GUI form.

In this, a ball is moving starting from middle and goes to up-left in starting. 

But then it collides with wall and changes direction but speed remain same. 

Consequently, it comes to downward direction where it should be hit by a rectangular paddle (which is capable of moving in horizontal direction) in order to continue.

Pause the game.

If the ball not hit by the paddle and hit at the bottom then game is over.

Restart the game.
